I may come back to this someday, but as I progressed I realised that this should've always been 3 separate projects but took too long to accept that. If I revive this, it'll be as separate projects, though I'd still like to make them able to communicate between themselves.

I also started rewriting the entire thing as my knowledge of Java expanded but it was going to be far too much work for something I wouldn't be pleased with due to all being under one hood, so I'm archiving the project for now and may start it over in the future with a better plan from the start.
