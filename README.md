So far all this does is allow you to send tweets from the Java GUI. I plan on adding Twitch chat functionality, including a bot to send messages periodically.

The keys/tokens in Setup.java have been censored on here for obvious reasons. When I finish the main project, I'll probably set something up to allow other people to use it too. For now, that's a pain and Twitter's documentation sucks.
